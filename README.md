🌬️ AirHealthNYC

## 📊 Project Overview
The **AirHealthNYC** project aims to explore the connection between air quality, specifically PM 2.5 levels, and asthma-related emergency visits in various neighborhoods of New York City (NYC) over multiple years. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical investigation, this project seeks to uncover patterns and trends that highlight the impact of air pollution on public health, particularly among children.

## 📝 Problem Statement
The goal is to analyze how variations in PM 2.5 levels correlate with the frequency of asthma-related emergency visits across different NYC regions (UHF42). The project focuses on detecting patterns, trends, and correlations using real-world data from NYC's air quality and health statistics.

## 📌 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Visualize PM 2.5 levels and distribution across different NYC neighborhoods.
- Analyze the relationship between air pollution levels (PM 2.5) and asthma-related emergency department visits.
- Implement linear regression and perform residual analysis.
- Create various insightful visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and pie charts.
- Conduct additional exploratory analysis, including outlier detection and pairplots.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Spyder / VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Distribution and trends of PM 2.5 levels across neighborhoods.
- Correlation between PM 2.5 levels and asthma-related emergency visits.
- Seasonal variations in PM 2.5 concentrations.
